## 🎯 The Vision: Polyglobe Aesthetic + ProofLocker DNA

Inspired by **pizzint.watch/polyglobe** but with ProofLocker's identity:

### Polyglobe Elements We Captured:
- ✅ **Dark, minimalist aesthetic** - sleek data visualization
- ✅ **Glowing hotspots** that pop against dark globe
- ✅ **Space/night background** - looking down from orbit
- ✅ **Smooth, cinematic rotation** - always moving
- ✅ **Focus on the data** - markers are the stars
- ✅ **Clean, modern UI** - no clutter

### ProofLocker DNA We Kept:
- 🟣 **Purple atmosphere glow** (#5B21B6 - ProofLocker brand color)
- 🌌 **Dark gradient background** (purple-to-black radial gradient)
- 🎨 **Color scheme:** Red/Green/Orange markers for status
- 💎 **Premium tooltips:** Purple borders, gradient backgrounds
- 🔮 **"If it's not on chain, it didn't happen"** philosophy

---

## 🌟 What Makes It Special

### Dark Globe
- Uses **Earth at night** texture (city lights visible)
- No bright colors - stays mysterious and sleek
- Flat surface (no bump mapping) - clean look
- Purple atmospheric glow around edges

### Glowing Hotspots
- **Large, prominent markers** (1.5x bigger than before)
- Float above the globe surface
- Pulsing animation for fresh claims (dramatic bounce)
- Color-coded: 🔴 Red (breaking) 🟢 Green (verified) 🟠 Orange (mixed)

### Space Vibes
- Deep space starfield background
- Radial gradient: purple center → black edges
- Feels like viewing Earth from ISS
- Minimal distractions

### Smooth Interactions
- Auto-rotate at 0.3 speed (perfect balance)
- Damped camera movement (cinematic feel)
- Hover markers → elegant tooltip
- Click markers → side panel slides in
